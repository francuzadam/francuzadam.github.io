The economical implementation of transportation and other logistics operations lead to increased challenges in the package delivery sector. The dynamically changing demands of customers has a great impact on the efficiency, reliability, quality and availability of these services. To this end, the development of supply chains is increasingly driven by the emergence and diffusion of advanced technologies in the fourth industrial revolution, not only in manufacturing but also in services. One of the most controversial of these technologies is drones. In this paper, the authors show how drone-based material handling can be integrated into a conventional truck-based package delivery process and how the branch and bound methodology can be applied to the optimal design of drone delivery tasks.
